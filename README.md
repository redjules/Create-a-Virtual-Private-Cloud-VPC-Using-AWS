# Create a Virtual Private Cloud VPC Using AWS

In this project, we are going to focus on five objectives:

- Explain the use of virtual private cloud networks (use, advantages, and disadvantages) 

- Identify key concepts required to create and use a VPC 

- Compare and contrast the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform to other similar platforms 

- Set Up an Amazon Web Services Account 

- Create a virtual private cloud (VPC) network using the AWS cloud console

The project is divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: The learner will examine the use of virtual private cloud networks in a business context.
  
- Task 2: The learner will examine key concepts required to create and use a VPC.
  
- Task 3:  The learner will explore the differences in three popular cloud services: Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure Console, and Amazon Web Services.
  
- Task 4: The learner will set up an Amazon Web Services Account.
  
- Task 5: The learner will create a virtual private cloud (VPC) network using the AWS cloud console.
